# Prediction-of-BreastCancer-Using-SVM
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict breast cancer using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

The SVM algorithm implemented in this project learns to classify breast cancer tumors into malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) categories by analyzing a set of features extracted from breast imaging data, such as mammography or ultrasound images.
